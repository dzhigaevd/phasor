Currently the code undergoes testing and development with APS 34 ID-C, P10, and NanoMAX data.

The code is based on my own developments and other groups:
- Yang, David, Nicholas W. Phillips, and Felix Hofmann. "Mapping data between sample and detector conjugated spaces in Bragg coherent diffraction imaging." Journal of synchrotron radiation 26.6 (2019).
- Clark, J. N., et al. "High-resolution three-dimensional partially coherent diffraction imaging." Nature communications 3.1 (2012): 1-6.
- Some adaptations from: https://github.com/carnisj/bcdi
